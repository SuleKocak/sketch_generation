    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you are expected to implement a **conditional generative diffusion model** that learns to generate hand-drawn sketches in a **stroke-by-stroke** sequential manner. Rather than generating the entire sketch at once, your model should mimic the **sequential nature of human drawing**, producing strokes one after another in a realistic and interpretable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/) dataset released by Google, which provides timestamped vector representations of user-drawn sketches across 345 object categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and train a **separate conditional diffusion model** for each of the following three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cat`\n",
    "- `bus`\n",
    "- `rabbit`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model must learn to generate sketches from that category using **sequential stroke data**. That means you will build **three separate models** in total‚Äîone per category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your implementation must be documented in a reproducible Jupyter notebook, including training steps, visualizations, and both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include comprehensive documentation of your approach and design decisions.\n",
    "- Provide clear training procedures, model architecture explanations, and inference code.\n",
    "- Ensure full reproducibility (running all cells should yield consistent results with fixed random seeds).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "The Quick, Draw! dataset includes over 50 million sketches in vector format, with each sketch consisting of multiple strokes, where each stroke is a sequence of coordinates (`x`, `y`) along with timing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the raw `.ndjson` files from the this [section](#cell-id1). The following commands will download the required categories (`cat`, `bus`, `rabbit`) into the ./data directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** If you're not using Google Colab or Kaggle, make sure you have `gsutil` installed. You can install it via pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install gsutil\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The dataset files are in [NDJSON](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec) format. Make sure to install the ndjson Python module before attempting to parse the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install ndjson\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train/Test Subsets for Target Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading the dataset in the `./data` directory, extract the provided `subset.zip` file. This archive includes the predefined train/test splits for each of the three categories.\n",

    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "You must evaluate your model both **qualitatively** and **quantitatively**.\n",

    "### Quantitative Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following metrics to compare the real test set sketches with those generated by your model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance)**\n",
    "- **KID (Kernel Inception Distance)**\n",

    "These metrics should be computed **separately for each category** using the sketches indexed under the `\"test\"` key in each category‚Äôs `indices.json` file.\n",

    "### Qualitative Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide visual demonstrations including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample generated sketches for each category.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission should include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A well-structured **Jupyter Notebook** that:\n",
    "  - Explains your approach and design decisions\n",
    "  - Implements the conditional diffusion model\n",
    "  - Includes training procedure and inference pipeline code\n",
    "  - Presents both qualitative and quantitative results\n",
    "  - Visual examples of generated sketches for each of the 3 categories\n",
    "  - Animated GIFs demonstrating progressive sketch generation (similar to the provided example.gif)\n",
    "  - Clearly computed FID/KID scores for each category\n",
    "- Model performance analysis across categories\n",
    "- Comparison of generated vs. real sketch characteristics\n",
    "- Discussion of limitations and potential improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> üîí All visualizations must be based on sketches generated by your own model. Using samples from external sources will be considered **plagiarism** and will result in disqualification.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üîÅ The notebook must be **fully reproducible**: running all cells from top to bottom should produce the same results (assuming fixed random seed).\n",
